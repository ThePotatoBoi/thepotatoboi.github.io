                        The entire globe has evolved into a global community. We have joined the global community as citizens. What happens in one area of the world, no matter far away, impacts us. According to a song, “it’s a tiny world, after all.” And it is hoped that we are able to propose solutions to these global problems.

                    <p>So, to honor this ground, ponder by the question below:</p>

                                You happened to die in a terrible accident. It was unfortunate. You wanted to know more about what the future holds for you. But it all ended in an instant. You soon opened your eyes, finding yourself alone in nothingness. And moments after, a ball of light flashed through your eyes, and you instantly understood it was some sort of deity.                         
                            </p>

                                “I will give you a second chance to live another life,” howled the ball of light shining upon you. “But since you died unfairly, I will give you one wish to change something in your next world.”
                            </p>

                        And hey, luckily, you happened to know the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals for humanity. If you want to use your knowledge on that, which among the 17 goals do you wish the world to achieve?

                                Global temperatures are rising, and by 2100, they are expected to rise from 2.6 degrees Celsius to 4.8 degrees Celsius. This would result in more severe weather, food, and resource shortages, and disease transmission.

                                Whether it is a city-wide war, hatred directed at a specific group of people, or sexual harassment on the street, violence is prevalent but an avoidable problem that has gone unaddressed for far too long. Here are some examples of different types of violence according to Violence Prevention Initiative (2014):

                                This involves the safety of an individual in their homes, the proximity of healthcare to people, etc. The United Nations began a momentum on abolishing issues involving these. International treaties, agreements, and pacts—to name a few.

                                More than 72 million children of primary education age around the world remain unschooled due to marginalization, poverty, financial deficit, and inequality (Humanium.org, 2018).

                                Many people, particularly those aged 15 to 24, struggle to obtain work and provide a decent living for themselves and their families. This results in a scarcity of essential resources such as food, clothes, transportation, and adequate living circumstances.

                                Graft, bribery, embezzlement, backdoor deals, nepotism, and favoritism are all examples of corruption. As a major source of poverty, corruption disproportionately affects the poor, undermining political and economic growth, democracy, and other aspects of life. As of Transparency International’s 2013 corruption ranking, the Philippines stood at 94th among 177 nations (Moss, 2014).

                                As the OHCHR (n.d.) implied, terrorism “involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages.” It diminishes the public's sense of security and threatens democracy. Schools are one of the hotspots of these attacks.

Teachers should also provide accurate information and help them make sense of what is happening in a neutral, coherent narration. And finally, and most importantly, listen and abide by the instructions of authorities.
