            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                On the 26th of June 1892, Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila caused quite a commotion in the country. Being one of the <i>Illustrados</i>—the educated Filipino class—the Spaniards were pressured by Rizal's presence. By this time, Rizal's works were openly known in the country and by the Spaniards.

            <p>
               As he had planned, on July 3rd of the same year, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina in the house of Doroteo Ongjungco in Tondo, Manila. The organization’s goal was to have a Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes—not for a revolution that Spaniards had speculated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Days later, the Spanish authority arrested Rizal to Fort Santiago to be soon exiled in Dapitan for <b>four</b> years because of the following charges:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For possessing anti-friar bills <i>Pobres Frailes</i>&mdash;a leaflet about Dominican friars and their corrupt acts&mdash;in which advocacies violated the Spanish Government,
                </li>
                <li>
                    dedicating his novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> to the <i>GomBurZa</i> (Father Gomez, Burgos, Zamora), and
                </li>
                <li>
                    criticizing the religion and aiming for its exclusion from Filipino culture.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <slidedown-box title="But, hey. What do we mean by 'exile'?">
                <p>
                    Exile means "to banish or expel from one's own country or home" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).

                <h1>I. Arrival on Dapitan</h1>
                <p>
                    Rizal arrived in Dapitan on the night of 17th July 1892. He was guarded by <b>Ricardo Carcinero</b>, the politico-military governor of Dapitan, in a streamer named <i>Cebu</i>.

                <slidedown-box title="Wait. Hang on. Why Dapitan of all places?">
                    <p>
                        Well, one alleged reason was for the Spaniards to isolate Rizal. They fear his immense influence can shift something in current Filipino minds.
                    </p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    Opposite to Rizal's expectations, Carcinero and Spanish guards treated him with utmost modesty and respect. And on the same night, he met two friars named <b>Fr. Antonio Obach</b> and <b>Fr. Pablo Pastells</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Carnicero's supervision, he gave Rizal choices where he would stay: (1) stay at the house of Carnicero or (2) stay at the convent with Fr. Obach and the priests. However, Fr. Obach had conditions for Rizal to stay at the convent with the priests. That is, Rizal must
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>publicly retract his <i>errors</i> concerning religion and state that he is pro-Spanish and against the revolution</li>
                    <li>perform church rites and confess his past life, and</li>
                    <li>conduct himself in an exemplary manner as a Spanish subject and a man of religion.</li>
                </ul>
                <slidedown-box title="What did Rizal chose?">
                    <p>Rizal chose to stay with Carcinero. Allegedly, Rizal and Carcinero both enjoyed the company of one another as Carcinero treated Rizal more like a visitor than a captive. He even allowed Rizal to move freely inside the Dapitan.</p>

            <section title="II Rizal and Dapitan" alt-title="II">

                <h2>II. Rizal Life in Talisay, Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    On September 21, Rizal won a PHP 20,000 lottery with Carnicero. His portion amounts to PHP 6,200, which he used to buy land in barangay Talisay, where Rizal built a house, a school, and an eye clinic. With the help of Carnicero, he wrote a letter to the Governor General to allow his mother and sisters in Dapitan. Additionally, he also beautified the Dapitan Plaza, stood lampposts around the town, and organized a clean water system for the people.
                </p>

                </content-image>
                <p>
                    On the 4th of May 1893, Carnicero was replaced by <b>Captain Juan Sitges</b>. He did not want to live with a deportee, and he assigned Rizal to live in a house near the headquarters. He ordered Rizal to appear before him three times a week.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Rizal had many visitors in Dapitan, one of which was <b>George Taufer</b> with his eighteen-year-old adopted daughter <b>Josephine Bracken</b> who came along. There also came <b>Pablo Mercado</b> (his real identity, <b>Florencio Namaan</b>), a spy of the friars who posed as Rizal's relatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that time, Rizal had a relationship with Josephine Bracken, even wanting to get married only to get opposed by Fr. Obach. Despite that, the couple considered themselves official. The couple even had a son, who soon died three hours after birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rizal's affection for Bracken was pretty obvious. However, Rizal's relatives and friends distrust Josephine, suspiciously thinking she might be a spy from the Spanish government because Brackens' tour guide, Manuela Orlac, was close to the friars.

                <p>
                    Soon, maybe far later, another visitor was <b>Pio Valenzuela</b>&mdash;an emissary of Andres Bonifacio&mdash;telling Rizal about the founding of Katipunan and asking for advice on how to launch a revolution.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box title="What was Rizal's response?">

                        <li>the Filipino people lacked preparedness for such a devastating revolution,</li>
                        <li>the Katipunan lacked weaponry—considering how large the Spanish military strength, and</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite this, Rizal also advised Antonio Luna as their general and leader of the revolution. Rizal also warned that many innocents would die, giving them an insight into the possible consequences of the revolution.</p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>Valenzuela also told Rizal of their plan to rescue him in Dapitan. Again, the exiled hero disagreed because he had no plan of breaking his word of honor to the Spanish authorities.</p>

                <h2>IV. Farewell to Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    After rendering Rizal's duty as a volunteer doctor in an epidemic in Cuba, Rizal received his clearance for his exiled status to be uplifted. On July 31, 1896, Rizal finally left Dapitan and soon arrived in Manila to supposedly go overseas once again. His trip, however, was continuously, suspiciously delayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his trip to Spain, Rizal was transferred to cruiser Castilla, and stayed there for a month, from August 6 to September 2, 1896.

                <p>
                    Weeks later, on August 26 of the same year, Bonifacio and the Katipunan raised the <b>Cry of Revolution</b> (<i>Sigaw sa Pugadlawin</i>) in the hills of Balintawak. Soon, <b>Governor-General Ramon Blanco</b> declared a <i>state of war</i> in the provinces of Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija and placed them under martial law. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By then, Rizal was stuck in Manila as he received letters that had charged him as one of the perpetrators of the raging revolution. Also, he received a letter from the Governor General absolving him of all the blame for the raging revolution. Rizal transferred to the ship <i>Isla de Panay</i>, sailing for Barcelona, Spain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following advice from Don Pedro Roxas, Rizal took advantage of the protection of British law in Singapore.

                    On September 30, 1896, as the <i>Isla de Panay</i> was sailing in the Mediterranean, a telegraphic order was received for the arrest of José Rizal. The request for his arrest came from <b>Bernardino Nozaleda</b>, the Archbishop of Manila, who had accused Rizal of being the driving force behind the revolution.

                    On October 3, 1896, the <i>Isla de Panay</i> reached Barcelona, and Rizal was taken into custody. He was subsequently imprisoned in <i>Montjuich Castle</i>, a prison fortress. Upon arriving at the prison, Rizal was interviewed by <b>Governor-General Despujol</b>, informing him that he would be sent back to Manila. On the same day, Rizal was taken abroad on the ship named <i>Colon</i>, which was loaded with Spanish troops, and sailed for Manila.
