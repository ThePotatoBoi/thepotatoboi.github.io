                    <h1>Introduction</h1>

                    <p>
                        On the 26th of June 1892, Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila caused quite a turmoil in the country. He was known for achievements which the Spaniards had feared. And by this time, his works are openly known in the country and by the Spaniards.

                    <p>
                        As he had planned, on July 3rd of the same year, Rizal founded <b><i>La Liga Filipina</i></b> in Tondo, Manila. The organization’s goal was to have a Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes—not for a revolution that Spaniards had speculated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Days later, unsurprisingly, the Spanish authority arrested Rizal to be exiled in Dapitan for four years.

                                <p>The following constitute charges the Spanish government accused to Rizal for him to be exiled in Dapitan for four years:</p>

                                        For publishing anti-Catholic and anti-friar books and articles,

                                    <li>
                                        possessing handbills of <i>Pobres Frailes</i>—a leaflet about Dominican friars and their corrupt acts—in which advocacies violated the Spanish Government,
                                    </li>

                                        dedicating his novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> to the <i>GomBurZa</i> (Gomez, Burgos, Zamora) “emphasizing” on the novel’s title page that the only salvation for the Philippines was separation from the mother country, and
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        criticizing the religion and aiming for its exclusion from Filipino culture.

                    <p>Rizal arrived in Dapitan, Zamboanga Del Norte on the night of 17th July. He was guarded by <b>Ricardo Carcinero</b>, the politico-military governor of Dapitan, in a streamer named <i>Cebu</i>.</p>

                    <p>Opposite to Rizal’s expectations, Carcinero and Spanish guards treated him with utmost modesty and respect. And on the same night, he met two friars named <b>Fr. Antonio Obach</b> and <b>Fr. Pablo Pastells</b>.</p>

                    <p>Fr. Obach gave Rizal choices where he would stay: (1) stay at the house of Carcinero or (2) stay at the convent with Fr. Obach and the priests. However, Fr. Obach had conditions for Rizal to stay at the convent with the priests. That is, Rizal must</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>publicly retract his errors concerning religion,</li>
                        <li>perform church rites and confess his past life, and</li>
                        <li>conduct himself in an exemplary manner as a Spanish subject and a man of religion.</li>
                    </ul>

                                <p>Rizal chose to stay with Carcinero. Allegedly, Rizal and Carcinero both enjoyed the company of one another as Carcinero treated Rizal more like a visitor than a captive. He even allowed Rizal to move freely inside the Dapitan.</p>

                    <h2>II. Rizal and Dapitan</h2>
                    
                    <p>On September 21, Rizal won a PHP 20,000 lottery together with Carcinero. His portion amounts to PHP 6,200, which he used to buy land in barangay Talisay, where Rizal built a house, a school, and an eye clinic.</p>

                    <p>Soon, Rizal had many visitors in Dapitan, one of which was <b>George Taufer</b>—who had problems with his eyesight and had an appointment with Rizal—with his eighteen-year-old adopted daughter <b>Josephine Bracken</b> who came along.</p>

                    <p>During that time, Rizal had a relationship with Josephine Bracken, even wanting to get married only to get opposed by Fr. Obach. Defiant, Obach once again insists Rizal retract his beliefs and confess his errors. Despite that, the couple considered themselves official. The couple even had a son, who soon died because the infant was born prematurely.</p>

                    <p>Rizal’s affection for Bracken was pretty obvious. However, Rizal’s relatives and friends distrust Josephine, suspiciously thinking that she might be a spy from the Spanish government.</p>

                    <p>Soon, maybe far later, another visitor was Pio Valenzuela—an emissary of Andres Bonifacio—telling Rizal about the founding of Katipunan and asking for advice on how to launch a revolution.</p>

                    <p>On July 31, 1896, Rizal left Dapitan and soon arrived in Manila to supposedly go overseas once again. His trip, however, was continuously, suspiciously delayed.</p>

                    <p>Weeks later, on August 26 of the same year, Bonifacio and the Katipunan raised the <b>Cry of Revolution</b> (<i>Sigaw sa Pugadlawin</i>) in the hills of Balintawak. Soon, governor-general Ramon Blanco declared a "state of war" in the provinces of Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija and place them under martial law.</p>

                    <p>By that, Rizal was stuck in Manila as he received letters that had charged him as one of the perpetrators of the raging revolution.</p>
