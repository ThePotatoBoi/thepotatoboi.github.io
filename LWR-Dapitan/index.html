            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                On the 26th of June 1892, Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila caused quite a commotion in the country. Being one of the <i>Illustrados</i>—the educated Filipino class—the Spaniards were pressured by Rizal's presence. By this time, Rizal's works were openly known in the country and by the Spaniards.

            <p>
               As he had planned, on July 3rd of the same year, Rizal founded La Liga Filipina in the house of Doroteo Ongjungco in Tondo, Manila. The organization's goal was to have a Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes—not for a revolution that Spaniards had speculated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Days later, the Spanish authority arrested Rizal to Fort Santiago to be soon exiled in Dapitan for <b>four</b> years because of the following charges:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    For possessing anti-friar bills <i>Pobres Frailes</i>&mdash;a leaflet about Dominican friars and their corrupt acts&mdash;in which advocacies violated the Spanish Government,
                </li>
                <li>
                    dedicating his novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> to the <i>GomBurZa</i> (Father Gomez, Burgos, Zamora), and
                </li>
                <li>
                    criticizing the religion and aiming for its exclusion from Filipino culture.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <slidedown-box title="But, hey. What do we mean by 'exile'?">
                <p>
                    Exile means "to banish or expel from one's own country or home" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).

                <h1>I. Arrival on Dapitan</h1>
                <p>
                    Rizal arrived in Dapitan on the night of 17th July 1892. He was guarded by <b>Ricardo Carnicero</b>, the politico-military governor of Dapitan, in a streamer named <i>Cebu</i>.

                <slidedown-box title="Wait. Hang on. Why Dapitan of all places?">
                    <p>
                        Well, one alleged reason was for the Spaniards to isolate Rizal. They fear his immense influence can shift something in current Filipino minds.
                    </p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    Opposite to Rizal's expectations, Carnicero and Spanish guards treated him with utmost modesty and respect. And on the same night, he met two friars named <b>Fr. Antonio Obach</b> and <b>Fr. Pablo Pastells</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under Carnicero's supervision, he gave Rizal choices where he would stay: (1) stay at the house of Carnicero or (2) stay at the convent with Fr. Obach and the priests. However, Fr. Obach had conditions for Rizal to stay at the convent with the priests. That is, Rizal must
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>publicly retract his <i>errors</i> concerning religion and state that he is pro-Spanish and against the revolution</li>
                    <li>perform church rites and confess his past life, and</li>
                    <li>conduct himself in an exemplary manner as a Spanish subject and a man of religion.</li>
                </ul>
                <slidedown-box title="What did Rizal chose?">
                    <p>Rizal chose to stay with Carnicero. Allegedly, Rizal and Carnicero both enjoyed the company of one another as Carnicero treated Rizal more like a visitor than a captive. He even allowed Rizal to move freely inside the Dapitan.</p>

            <section title="II Rizal and Dapitan" alt-title="II">

                <h2>II. Rizal Life in Talisay, Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    On September 21, Rizal won a PHP 20,000 lottery with Carnicero. His portion amounts to PHP 6,200, which he used to buy land in barangay Talisay, where Rizal built a house, a school, and an eye clinic. With the help of Carnicero, he wrote a letter to the Governor General to allow his mother and sisters in Dapitan. Additionally, he also beautified the Dapitan Plaza, stood lampposts around the town, and organized a clean water system for the people.

                </content-image>
                <p>
                    On the 4th of May 1893, Carnicero was replaced by <b>Captain Juan Sitges</b>. He did not want to live with a deportee, and he assigned Rizal to live in a house near the headquarters. He ordered Rizal to appear before him three times a week.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Rizal had many visitors in Dapitan, one of which was <b>George Taufer</b> with his eighteen-year-old adopted daughter <b>Josephine Bracken</b> who came along. There also came <b>Pablo Mercado</b> (his real identity, <b>Florencio Namaan</b>), a spy of the friars who posed as Rizal's relatives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During that time, Rizal had a relationship with Josephine Bracken, even wanting to get married only to get opposed by Fr. Obach. Despite that, the couple considered themselves official. The couple even had a son, who soon died three hours after birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rizal's affection for Bracken was pretty obvious. However, Rizal's relatives and friends distrust Josephine, suspiciously thinking she might be a spy from the Spanish government because Brackens' tour guide, Manuela Orlac, was close to the friars.

                <p>
                    Soon, maybe far later, another visitor was <b>Pio Valenzuela</b>&mdash;an emissary of Andres Bonifacio&mdash;telling Rizal about the founding of Katipunan and asking for advice on how to launch a revolution.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box title="What was Rizal's response?">
                    <p>With cadency, Rizal outspokenly objected to the idea of the revolution for the reason of</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the Filipino people lacked preparedness for such a devastating revolution,</li>
                        <li>the Katipunan lacked weaponry—considering how large the Spanish military strength, and</li>
                        <li>the lack of support of the rich and influential people of Manila to strengthen their cause,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite this, Rizal also advised Antonio Luna as their general and leader of the revolution. Rizal also warned that many innocents would die, giving them an insight into the possible consequences of the revolution.</p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>Valenzuela also told Rizal of their plan to rescue him in Dapitan. Again, the exiled hero disagreed because he had no plan of breaking his word of honor to the Spanish authorities.</p>

            <section title="IV Farewell" alt-title="IV">

                <h2>IV. Farewell to Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    After rendering Rizal's duty as a volunteer doctor in an epidemic in Cuba, Rizal received his clearance for his exiled status to be uplifted. On July 31, 1896, Rizal finally left Dapitan and soon arrived in Manila to supposedly go overseas once again. His trip, however, was continuously, suspiciously delayed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On his trip to Spain, Rizal was transferred to cruiser Castilla, and stayed there for a month, from August 6 to September 2, 1896.

                <p>
                    Weeks later, on August 26 of the same year, Bonifacio and the Katipunan raised the <b>Cry of Revolution</b> (<i>Sigaw sa Pugadlawin</i>) in the hills of Balintawak. Soon, <b>Governor-General Ramon Blanco</b> declared a <i>state of war</i> in the provinces of Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija and placed them under martial law. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    By then, Rizal was stuck in Manila as he received letters that had charged him as one of the perpetrators of the raging revolution. Also, he received a letter from the Governor General absolving him of all the blame for the raging revolution. Rizal transferred to the ship <i>Isla de Panay</i>, sailing for Barcelona, Spain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following advice from Don Pedro Roxas, Rizal took advantage of the protection of British law in Singapore.

                    On September 30, 1896, as the <i>Isla de Panay</i> was sailing in the Mediterranean, a telegraphic order was received for the arrest of José Rizal. The request for his arrest came from <b>Bernardino Nozaleda</b>, the Archbishop of Manila, who had accused Rizal of being the driving force behind the revolution.

                    On October 3, 1896, the <i>Isla de Panay</i> reached Barcelona, and Rizal was taken into custody. He was subsequently imprisoned in <i>Montjuich Castle</i>, a prison fortress. Upon arriving at the prison, Rizal was interviewed by <b>Governor-General Despujol</b>, informing him that he would be sent back to Manila. On the same day, Rizal was taken abroad on the ship named <i>Colon</i>, which was loaded with Spanish troops, and sailed for Manila.

                <p>
                    <b>Dr. Antonio Ma. Rigidor</b> and <b>Sixto Lopez</b> made considerable efforts to find legal representation for their friend, Rizal, in Singapore. <b>Attorney Hugh Fort</b>, an English lawyer practicing in Singapore, was sought to assist Rizal. However, <b>Chief Justice Lionel</b>, presiding in Singapore, denied the request on the grounds that the <b><i>Writ of Habeas Corpus</i></b> did not apply since Rizal was on a Spanish ship.

                <slidedown-box title="What does the Writ of Habeas Corpus imply?">

                        The <b><i>Writ of Habeas Corpus</i></b> "is used to bring a prisoner or other detainee before the court to determine if the person's imprisonment or detention is lawful" (Cornell Law School Legal Information Insitute, n.d.).

                    On November 3, 1896, Colon arrived at Manila Bay. Rizal was brought to <b>Fort Santiago</b> in Intramuros. Rizal faced a Spanish military tribunal led by <b>Colonel Francisco Olive</b>. The tribunal relied on oral testimonies to implicate Rizal in the activities of the Philippine Revolution.

                <p>
                    Rizal presented twelve detailed arguments in his defense:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>He could not be guilty of rebellion, for he advised Dr Pio Valenzuela in Dapitan not to rise in revolution.</li>
                    <li>He did not correspond with the radical, revolutionary elements.</li>
                    <li>The revolutionists used his name without his knowledge. If he were guilty he could have escaped in Singapore.</li>
                    <li>If he had a hand in the revolution, he could have escaped in a Moro vinta and would not have built a home, a hospital, and bought lands in Dapitan.</li>
                    <li>If he were the chief of the revolution, why was he not consulted by the revolutionaries?</li>
                    <li>It was true he wrote the by-laws of the Liga Filipina, but this is only a civic organization—not a revolutionary society.</li>
                    <li>The Liga Filipina did not live long, for after the first meeting he was banished to Dapitan and it died out.</li>
                    <li>If the Liga was reorganized nine months later, he did not know about it.</li>
                    <li>The Liga did not serve the purpose of the revolutionists, otherwise they would not have supplanted it with the Katipunan.</li>
                    <li>If it were true that there were some bitter comments in Rizal's letters, it was because they were written in 1890 when his family was being persecuted, being dispossessed of houses, warehouses, lands, etc., and his brother and all brothers-in-law were deported.</li>
                    <li>His life in Dapitan had been exemplary as the politico-military commanders and missionary priests could attest.</li>
                    <li>It was not true that the revolution was inspired by his one speech at the house of Doroteo Ongjunco, as alleged by witnesses whom he would like to confront. His friends knew his opposition to armed rebellion. Why did the Katipunan send an emissary to Dapitan who was unknown to him? Because those who knew him were aware that he would never sanction any violent movement.</li>

                <h1>VII. Efforts to Persuade Rizal to Retract</h1>
                <p>At around three o'clock in the afternoon, after Fr. Balaguer's departure, Rizal's mother and sisters arrived. Rizal gave an alcohol stove to his sister Trinidad, a gift from <b>Pardo De Tavera</b>, and whispered to her in English, "There is something inside." He also instructed Trinidad to look inside his shoes after his execution.</p>
                <p>Following his family's departure, <b>Fathers Vilaclara</b> and <b>Balaguer</b> returned in an attempt to convince Rizal to retract his beliefs. Around 8:00 in the evening, Fr. Balaguer returned with Fr. Viza and continued discussions with Rizal on religious matters, joined by <b>Fiscal Gaspar Castaño</b> of the Royal Audiencia.</p>
                <p>At approximately 10:00, a draft of the retraction arrived from <b>Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda</b>, which Rizal retracted. Another draft was prepared by <b>Fr. Pio Pi</b>, the superior of the Jesuit Mission in the Philippines. He liked the Work but wanted some changes.</p>
                <p>At 11:30, Rizal signed his retraction from Freemasonry, witnessed by <p>Juan del Fresno</p>, the Chief of the guard detail, and the Adjutant of the Plaza Eloy Moure.</p>
                <p>After signing the retraction, Rizal had a confession with Fr. Vilaclara and rested.</p>

                    <p>Do note that the retraction of Rizal is still unclear up to this time no one can tell if Rizal really retracted all his words against the Spanish government.</p>

                <h1>VIII. Rizal's Final Morning</h1>
                <p>At 5:00 in the morning of his execution, Rizal had his last breakfast. He autographed his remaining books, which would become his last souvenirs.</p>
                <p>Josephine Bracken arrived with Narcisa, Rizal's sister. <b>Fr. Balaguer</b> performed the marriage rites of Rizal and Josephine. They say that they forged the signature of Rizal and did not retract it because of the novel he wrote.
                </p>
                <p>Rizal gave a book to Josephine, "Imitacion de Cristo" by Thomas Kempis, which he autographed. Afterward, he wrote three farewell letters: one to <b>his parents</b>, another to <b>Dr. Blumentritt</b>, and a third to his brother, <b>Paciano</b>.</p>

                <h1>IX. The Execution</h1>
                <p>At around 6:30 in the morning, Rizal was taken from his cell, and the march to Bagumbayan (now Luneta) began.</p>
                <p>A colonel escorted Rizal to the execution site, where drums were placed in case Rizal wished to address the crowd. After that, Rizal requested two things to the firing squad.</p>
                <slidedown-box title="What were Rizal's final request?">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Rizal had requested that the firing squad <b>spare his head</b>, a request that was granted.</li>
                        <li>Rizal requested <b>to be shot in front</b>, which was <b>denied</b>. The firing squad was composed of Filipinos, with Spanish soldiers positioned behind them, pointing guns at them if they didn't shoot Rizal.</li>
                    </ol>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>Rizal protested that he was not a traitor to Spain. <b>Dr. Felipe Ruiz Castillo</b>, a medical doctor, checked Rizal's pulse and found that it was normal. Rizal's last words were "Consummatum est." before a <b>simultaneous crack of gunfire</b>. Rizal made one last effort to drop on his back with his face facing the sun.</p>

                <p>However, a medical check revealed that Rizal was still alive, forcing one firing squad member to shoot Rizal to end his life. And by that, Spanish spectators celebrated and shouted, "Viva España!" as the military band played "Marcha de Cadiz."</p>
                <p>Rizal's body was secretly buried at <b>Paco Cemetery</b>, later traced by his sister Narcissa.</p>
