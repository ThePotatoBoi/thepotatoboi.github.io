                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>
                    On the 26th of June 1892, Jose Rizal's arrival in Manila caused quite a commotion in the country. Being one of the Illustrados, the Spaniards were pressured by Rizal’s presence.

                <p>
                    As he had planned, on July 3rd of the same year, Rizal founded<b> La Liga Filipina</b> in Tondo, Manila. The organization’s goal was to have a Filipino representative in the Spanish Cortes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Days later, the Spanish authority arrested Rizal to Fort Santiago to be soon exiled in Dapitan for <b>four</b> years because of the following charges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For possessing anti-friar bills <i>Pobres Frailes</i>&mdash;a leaflet about Dominican friars and their corrupt acts&mdash;in which advocacies violated the Spanish Government,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        dedicating his novel, <i>Noli me Tangere</i> and <i>El Filibusterismo</i> to the <i>GomBurZa</i> (Father Gomez, Burgos, Zamora), and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        criticizing the religion and aiming for its exclusion from Filipino culture.
                    </li>

                <slidedown-modal title="But, hey. What do we mean by 'exile'?">

                        Exile means "to banish or expel from one's own country or home" (Merriam-Webster, n.d.).

                <h1>I. Arrival on Dapitan</h1>
                <p>
                    Rizal arrived in Dapitan on the night of 17th July 1892. He was guarded by <b>Ricardo Carcinero</b>, the politico-military governor of Dapitan, in a streamer named <i>Cebu</i>.

                <slidedown-modal title="Wait. Hang on. Why Dapitan of all places?">
                    <p>
                        Well, one alleged reason was for the Spaniards to isolate Rizal. They fear his immense influence can shift something in current Filipino minds.
                    </p>
                </slidedown-modal>
                <p>
                    Opposite to Rizal’s expectations, Carcinero and Spanish guards treated him with utmost modesty and respect. And on the same night, he met two friars named <b>Fr. Antonio Obach</b> and <b>Fr. Pablo Pastells</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fr. Obach gave Rizal choices where he would stay: (1) stay at the house of Carcinero or (2) stay at the convent with Fr. Obach and the priests. However, Fr. Obach had conditions for Rizal to stay at the convent with the priests. That is, Rizal must
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>publicly retract his <i>errors</i> concerning religion and state that he is pro-Spanish and against the revolution</li>
                    <li>perform church rites and confess his past life, and</li>
                    <li>conduct himself in an exemplary manner as a Spanish subject and a man of religion.</li>
                </ul>
                <slidedown-modal title="What did Rizal chose?">
                    <p>Rizal chose to stay with Carcinero. Allegedly, Rizal and Carcinero both enjoyed the company of one another as Carcinero treated Rizal more like a visitor than a captive. He even allowed Rizal to move freely inside the Dapitan.</p>

                <h2>II. Rizal and Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    On September 21, Rizal won a PHP 20,000 lottery together with Carcinero. His portion amounts to PHP 6,200, which he used to buy land in barangay Talisay, where Rizal built a house, a school, and an eye clinic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, Rizal had many visitors in Dapitan, one of which was <b>George Taufer</b> with his eighteen-year-old adopted daughter <b>Josephine Bracken</b> who came along.
                </p>
                <content-image limit-height
                    src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/7e/b3/51/7eb35102cc03119316ca0aa1f20963b7.jpg"

                </content-image>
                <p>
                    During that time, Rizal had a relationship with Josephine Bracken, even wanting to get married only to get opposed by Fr. Obach. Despite that, the couple considered themselves official. The couple even had a son, who soon died three hours after birth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rizal’s affection for Bracken was pretty obvious. However, Rizal’s relatives and friends distrust Josephine, suspiciously thinking that she might be a spy from the Spanish government.

                <p>
                    Soon, maybe far later, another visitor was <b>Pio Valenzuela</b>&mdash;an emissary of Andres Bonifacio&mdash;telling Rizal about the founding of Katipunan and asking for advice on how to launch a revolution.

                <slidedown-modal title="What was Rizal's response?">
                    <p>With cadency, Rizal outspokenly objected to the idea of the revolution for the reason of</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>the Filipino people lacked preparedness for such a devastating revolution,</li>
                        <li>the Katipunan lacked weaponry—considering how large the Spanish military strength, and</li>
                        <li>the lack of support of the rich and influential people of Manila to strengthen their cause,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Rizal also warned that many innocents would die, giving them an insight into the possible consequences of the revolution.</p>

                <h2>IV. Farewell to Dapitan</h2>
                <p>
                    On July 31, 1896, Rizal left Dapitan and soon arrived in Manila to supposedly go overseas once again. His trip, however, was continuously, suspiciously delayed.
                </p>

                </content-image>
                <p>
                    Weeks later, on August 26 of the same year, Bonifacio and the Katipunan raised the <b>Cry of Revolution</b> (<i>Sigaw sa Pugadlawin</i>) in the hills of Balintawak.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soon, governor-general Ramon Blanco declared a "state of war" in the provinces of Manila, Bulacan, Cavite, Pampanga, Tarlac, Laguna, Batangas, and Nueva Ecija and place them under martial law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By that, Rizal was stuck in Manila as he received letters that had charged him as one of the perpetrators of the raging revolution.
