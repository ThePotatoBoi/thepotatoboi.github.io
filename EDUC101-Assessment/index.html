                        Assessments play a fundamental role in facilitating classroom inclusion. It helps educators distinguish not just student needs but also what accommodation to consider for the disadvantaged ones.

                    <p>
                        <b>Assessment</b> refers to the variety of methods or tools teachers use to evaluate, measure, or document students’ academic readiness, learning progress, skill acquisition, or educational needs.

                                <p>Classifications of assessment include but are not limited to the following:</p>

                                        <b>Pre-assessments</b> (or <b>diagnostic assessments</b>) – are administered before students begin a lesson, unit, course, or academic program.

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Formative assessments</b> – are in-process evaluations of student learning that are typically administered multiple times during a unit, course, or academic program.

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Summative assessments</b> – are used to evaluate student learning after a specific instructional period—typically at the end of a unit, course, semester, program, or school year.

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Placement assessments</b> – are used to “place” students into a course, course level, or academic program.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Screening assessments</b> – determine whether students need specialized assistance or services or are ready to begin a course, grade level, or academic program.

                        Moreover, another classification of assessments is by their purpose (i.e., assessment <i>of</i> learning, assessment <i>for</i> learning, and assessment <i>as</i> learning).

                    <p>

                                        <b>Large prints</b> are hard copies that are larger than the standard ones. Sometimes there may be extra white space for students having difficulty focusing on the text.

                        <b>Instructional accommodations</b> change the student’s way of accessing academic content or progressing through the same learning goal. Note that these accommodations don’t change the standards a student is trying to achieve/accomplish.

                        <b>Portfolio assessments</b> are collections of student works associated with standards the teacher required them to learn. A portfolio assessment describes the student’s learning progression throughout the year. You can regard it as a reflective storybook of the student’s development.
