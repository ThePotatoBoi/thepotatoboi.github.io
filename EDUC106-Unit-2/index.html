                Objectives are essential to instructional design as they provide a clear roadmap for designing and delivering curriculum. Thus, teachers must know how to write and classify lesson objectives to help them select appropriate teaching methods, assessment strategies, and use instructional materials. After all, assessing learning outcomes is one of the functions of a teacher.

                <h1>Standard-Bassed Assessment</h1>
                <p>A <b>standard</b> acts as a benchmark for learning that defines what students need to know. Hence, standardizing assessment helps educators</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>judge students' work and performance within a clear set of criteria;</li>
                    <li>generate feedback for the learner and parent;</li>
                    <li>reflect and identify students' learning and areas of improvement; and</li>
                    <li>separate focus on academic performance, dispositions, behavior, attitude, effort, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Constructive Alignment</h1>
                <p>
                    One prominent feature of standard-based assessment is <b>constructive alignment</b>—an outcomes-based approach to teaching in which the learning outcomes that students intend to achieve are defined before teaching takes place.
                </p>
                <slidedown-box title="Question to Ponder:">
                    <p>Why is it important to define the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) before we teach?</p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    As developed and defined by <b>John Biggs (2014)</b>, constructive alignment involves thoughtfully determining intentions for what students should learn and how they will demonstrate their achievement of these intended learning outcomes (ILOs).

                <h1>K to 12 Assessment Guidelines</h1>
                <p>
                    In line with implementing the <b>Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013 (Republic Act No. 10533)</b>, the Department of Education adopted the enclosed <b>Policy Guidelines on Classroom Assessment for the K to 12 Basic Education Program (DO No. 8, S. 2015)</b>.

                <slidedown-box title="What is the theoretical basis of this framework?">
                    <p>
                        At the heart of this assessment framework is the recognition and deliberate consideration of the learners' <b>zone of proximal development</b> (Vygotsky, 1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, ensuring the learners' success in moving from guided to independent display of knowledge, understanding, and skills are features of this framework along with the development of learners' higher-order thinking skills and 21st-century skills.
                    </p>
                </slidedown-box>
                <p>
                    According to the policy guideline, assessment in the classroom is aimed at helping students perform well with the learning materials. Learning materials comprise of <b>content standards</b>, <b>performance standards</b>, and <b>learning competencies</b> outlined in the curriculum. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Content Standards</b> identify and set the essential knowledge and understanding that should be learned. They cover a specified scope of sequential topics within each learning strand, domain, theme, or component.
                        </p>
                        <slidedown-box title="What does content standard answer?">
                            <p>Content standard answers, "What should the learners know?"</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <b>Performance Standards</b> describe the abilities and skills that learners are expected to demonstrate with the content standards and integration of 21st-century skills. Knowledge, understanding, and skills are integrated through creation, innovation, and adding value to products/performance during independent work or collaboration.
                        </p>

                            <p>Performance standard, in the other hand, answers the following:</p>

                                <li>"How well do learners use their learning or understanding in different situations?"</li>
                                <li>"How do learners apply their learning or understanding in real-life contexts?"</li>
                                <li>"What tools and measures should learners use to demonstrate their knowledge?"</li>

                        <p><b>Learning competencies</b> refer to the knowledge, understanding, skills, and attitudes students must demonstrate in every lesson and learning activity.</p>

                </ol>

                    Another feat of the framework is the integration of <b>Cognitive Process Dimensions</b> adapted from <b>Aderson and Krathwohl (2001)</b> to provide a scheme for classifying educational goals, objectives, and standards (see Table 1).

                            Global temperatures are rising, and by 2100, they are expected to rise from 2.6 degrees Celsius to 4.8 degrees Celsius. This would result in more severe weather, food, and resource shortages, and disease transmission.

                            In terms of “bullying” in the country, we have the RA 10627, or the Anti-Bullying Act of 2013, to address these issues in schools.

                        <p>
                            This involves the safety of an individual in their homes, the proximity of healthcare to people, etc. The United Nations began a momentum on abolishing issues involving these. International treaties, agreements, and pacts—to name a few.

                                As Muston (2022) stated, “students who do not feel safe at school—either emotionally or physically—are more distracted and less successful than their peers. School safety and student achievement are connected; it’s hard to have one without the other.”

                            More than 72 million children of primary education age around the world remain unschooled due to marginalization, poverty, financial deficit, and inequality (Humanium.org, 2018).

                        <p>
                            Many people, particularly those aged 15 to 24, struggle to obtain work and provide a decent living for themselves and their families. This results in a scarcity of essential resources such as food, clothes, transportation, and adequate living circumstances.

                            Graft, bribery, embezzlement, backdoor deals, nepotism, and favoritism are all examples of corruption. As a major source of poverty, corruption disproportionately affects the poor, undermining political and economic growth, democracy, and other aspects of life. As of Transparency International’s 2013 corruption ranking, the Philippines stood at 94th among 177 nations (Moss, 2014).

                                “Malnutrition, in all its forms, includes undernutrition (wasting, stunting, being underweight), insufficient vitamins and minerals, overweight, obesity, and the resultant diet-related non-communicable illnesses.”

                            It is the “harmful or hazardous use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs” (WHO, 2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (2022) indicated, “around 284 million people aged 15-64 used drugs worldwide in 2020, a 26 percent increase over the previous decade.” And in the Philippines, the prevalence of drug use is 2.05%, equivalent to 1.7 million Filipinos (UN Philippines, 2021.)

                            As the OHCHR (n.d.) implied, terrorism “involves the intimidation or coercion of populations or governments through the threat or perpetration of violence, causing death, serious injury or the taking of hostages.” It diminishes the public's sense of security and threatens democracy. Schools are one of the hotspots of these attacks.

                                The study by Wansink et. al. (2021) revealed that teachers should first initiate a safe, calm classroom environment while monitoring students’ reactions. Teachers should also provide accurate information and help them make sense of what is happening in a neutral, coherent narration. And finally, and most importantly, listen and abide by the instructions of authorities.

                    In September 2015, The General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes 17 SDGs. Building on the principle of “leaving no one behind,” the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development (UN News, 2015).
