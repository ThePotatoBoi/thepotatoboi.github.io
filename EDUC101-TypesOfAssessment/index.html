                        Assessments play an important role in facilitating classroom inclusion. It helps educators distinguish not just student needs but also what accommodation to consider for the disadvantaged ones.

                        <b>Assessment</b> refers to the wide variety of methods or tools that educators use to evaluate, measure, and document the academic readiness, learning progress, skill acquisition, or educational needs of students.

                                <p> There are many classifications of assessment used by educators, which include but are not limited to the following:</p>

                                    <li>

                                        <b>Formative assessments</b> are in-process evaluations of student learning that are typically administered multiple times during a unit, course, or academic program.

                                    <li>
                                        <b>Summative assessments</b> are used to evaluate student learning after a specific instructional period—typically at the end of a unit, course, semester, program, or school year.

                                        <b>Placement assessments</b> are used to “place” students into a course, course level, or academic program.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Screening assessments</b> determine whether students may need specialized assistance or services or are ready to begin a course, grade level, or academic program.

                        Assessments can be also classified by their purpose (e.g. assessment <i>of</i> learning, assessment <i>for</i> learning, and assessment <i>as</i> learning).

                        <b>Observation checklists</b> are a set of questions or descriptions that assists an observer in evaluating an individual's performance and behavior.

                        <b>Anecdotal records</b> are narrative records (or can be short stories/comments) that educators use to document a significant incident that they have observed. These can help the teacher to understand their pupils realistically.

                    <p>
                        <b>Portfolio assessments</b> are collections of student works associated with standards the teacher required them to learn. A portfolio assessment describes the student’s learning progression throughout the year; that is, you can regard it as a reflective storybook of the student’s development.
